## Overview 
This is a proof of concept that you can interface a PS5 DualSense controller to TwinCAT via ADS.  In this example we use a Python script in order to provide the controller wrapper.  This example also shows TwinCAT HMI, 3D model control, TwinCAT HMI Scope among other technologies. 

## Video Tutorial
There is a free coding byte video tutorial on this code which can be found [here](https://codingbytes.teachable.com/p/codingbytes_twincat3)

## Getting Started
First start the PLC project running.  Next run the python script on the same IPC as the TwinCAT runtime.  Finally open Desktop.view and start live view by pressing the small [L] on the right hand side.    

## Installation of the Python Code
Download [hidapi](https://github.com/libusb/hidapi/releases) and place the x64 .dll file into your Workspace. After that install the package from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pydualsense/). 

```bash
pip install pydualsense
```

Currently there are a few modifications to the original pydualsense code which can be found in the src folder which allow the gyro and accelerometer to function.  These changes may be accepted in to the original repo.  Until then you will need to copy and replace the current pydualsense.py from [here](https://github.com/benhar-dev/pydualsense.git)
